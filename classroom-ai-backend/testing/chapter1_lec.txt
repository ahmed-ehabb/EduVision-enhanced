hello and welcome to introduction to psychology in this chapter we're going to be going over chapter one of the Open Stacks textbook my name is Matthew P I'm an instructor of psychology at Northeast State let's begin what is psychology psychology is the scientific study of behavior and the mind it gets its root the psych orsy which means soulology of course being the study of but as we know it today it is not the study of the Soul because Psychology by definition is a science we apply the scientific method to our understanding of behavior as well as mental processes that we are able to observe now I know right off the bat you may be thinking to yourself the mind isn't that more so an abstract concept and hey I totally get it whenever it comes to the mind I don't love that we have to utilize this definition because it leaves room for the unobservable and of course whenever it comes to science if we can't touch field taste or sense it how in the world can we adequately study it apply the scientific method and it be considered empiricism and so empiricism is ultimately another term for it is the empirical method which is based on unbiased observations okay that's the biggest thing too when it comes to science it has to be unbiased and it has to be falsifiable okay and so whenever you don't have something that's whenever you excuse me whenever you have something that's unobservable you can't falsify it's unfalsifiable some of the psychological perspectives that we're going to be looking at today include structuralism functionalism the psychoanalytic theory with Sigman Freud of course gestal psychology behaviorism as well as humanism on top of this today we're going to be ending on talking about different careers in psychology different jobs you can get with a bachelor's degree a master's degree a doctorate degree as well as the distinction between a psychologist versus a psychiatrist all right psychology gets its start officially in 1879 thanks to the help of vilhelm boont at the University of lipzig iny and so what vont was very much focused on was a concept his school of thought known as structuralism structuralism ultimately the reason that V came up with this idea is trying to model psychology after the hard Sciences how can we break down psychology or at that time he was wanting to look at Consciousness how can we break down Consciousness into elements similar to chemistry because with chemistry you've got your chemical compounds and ultimately with structuralism he was wanting to model that after something like chemistry where we're breaking down the Consciousness into elements where Maybe if we can break it down that way we can understand it a little bit more and how he started to study it or tried to what he tried to apply to structuralism is what's known as introspection so introspection is trying to examine your own conscious experience and I like to use the oxymoron trying to look Inward objectively and so that's oxymoronic because we can't look Inward and make observations ourselves in an unbiased manner in an objective manner anytime you add the human element to what you're trying to study and trying to make it scientific it's not going to work long term so this is why structuralism ultimately phased out as well as Consciousness in general is an unobservable entity okay whenever we move toward a little bit later with William James James thought that behavior or more mental functions is what he was more so focused on he was concerned about how mental activities help us to adapt and to survive and to advance he a big theory of evolution guy functionalism truly emphasized on how mental activities contribute to basic environmental survival hence functionalism so that was with William James one of the first Western psychologists or first American psychologists you can thank for functionalism now to we've got another individual who if you've ever heard about psychology you know of Sigman Freud now Freud has the concept of the psychoanalytic theory so it's a theory as well as he's got his therapy known as psychoanalysis a lot of people have heard of psychoanalysis before now the main tenant behind the psychoanalytic theory is that he thought that your mental difficulties as an adult were due to difficulties or problems in your childhood so when there was trauma in the childhood that could potentially manifest into mental difficulties as an adult on top of that he thought a lot of our difficulties arise from the unconscious mind he thinks that because uh we're unaware of what's causing us difficulties that's why it's manifesting in other behavioral deficits or difficulty now on top of this he had the psychoanalysis which psycho analysis a form of therapy where he would utilize what's known as free association so free Association is just another term for saying allowing the client to talk about whatever comes to mind so Freud can make connections to the unconscious mind and bring what's unconscious to Consciousness and that would at least be the first step in alleviating mental difficulty another thing that he would try to do is try to analyze your dreams now although he tried to and a lot of people probably believed him at that time we don't have an objective or unbiased or scientific way in which we can analyze your dreams even up until this point another funny thing that Freud was credited with is known as malapropisms so these are what's known as slips of the tongue or Freudian slip so according to Freud he's a big determinist which basically means that whenever you engage in a behavior there was a prior reason for why you engaged in that particular Behavior it has been determined for you okay and according to Freud if you accidentally do something apparently to frud there's no such thing as an accident there is a reason behind it so if you accidentally call your current partner by your ex partner's name to Freud that could use a little bit of analyzing all right moving forward so that's Freud there to the left a little bit of an image of him as well as one of the textbooks that he created a general introduction to psychoanalysis a huge figure and although a lot of his ideas are unfalsifiable a lot of his theories are unfalsifiable we still needed him to be an earlier figure to at least get a started and to build upon so Freud gets a lot of flak but again anytime you're starting a new science or a new field of study there's going to be hiccups there's going to be mistakes there's going to be a lot of things that people will look back on and criticize we have to Humble ourselves and understand that things take time and if we were to start a new field of study ourselves people would look back on us as well and see and criticize the mistakes that we made okay so moving forward so we have what's known as gestal ology the main principle behind gastal which means whole is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts so this Gasol psychology is based on the idea that although a sensory experience can be broken down into those individual Parts how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception so this is something that we're going to explore a little bit later when it comes to our sensation and perception chapter because thought Psychology was huge in sensation and perception now a few of the earlier figures ker kofka and wartimer were German psychologists who immigrated the United States to escape Nazi Germany so they have a very intriguing story that I encourage you to look into but they were those earlier figures to introduce us to gastal psychology okay moving forward we have what's known as behaviorism but under the behaviorism tenant we have Ivan Pavlov Who is credited with classical conditioning so everybody has at least probably at one point heard of Pavlov's dogs and but before we get into all of that throughout this course I'm going to say the word stimulus very often so a stimulus is literally anything person place or thing that elicits a response in an organism and under classical conditioning with Ivan pavlof he was able to train a dog to salivate to the ringing of a bell this is something that we're going to get a little bit more into death whenever we get into to chapter six learning we as humans as you'll learn and animals in general are really good Association machine we're not as great memory machines but we are really good at associating two or more stimuli together that's why whenever you're studying and you create an acronym for a particular long form either paragraph or terminology that you have to learn for your science classes when you break it down into like Pim daaz or whatever the case is it's a lot easier to remember that stuff because we are strong Association machines right classical conditioning is quite simply learning from Association like we already do but it helps us to anticipate events right in general we're training our reflexes food naturally causes a reflex within us so whenever we see especially when we're hungry we see or smell our favorite food we may begin to salivate similar to a dog right and before we condition or pair the two stimuli the food with a bell the Bell has no response and especially doesn't cause you to salivate right it may get your attention briefly but it's not going to cause any sort of reflex or natural reflex that you're born with okay now what we'll do whenever we are training you to associate something to anticipate an event we will ring a bell and right after that or simultaneously we will have the F food present and of course a dog is really good at learning this as well as you've probably done this over time and pretty quickly you're going to learn to associate and that dog is going to learn to associate that the Bell equals food is about to arrive so the Bell will elicit a reflex but it's not a natural reflex now it's a conditioned reflex okay so that's classical cond
